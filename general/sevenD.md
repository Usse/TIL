###Due Diligence
Ensure you’re comfortable with technology stack
That you are able to deliver within the timeframe
That you understand the project objectives
Know the project team members
Voice any concerns / potential risks you see early on
Understand what you’re delivering and how

###Design
Decide on libraries / tech you will be using

###Discuss
Validate your approach with more senior member of the team
Check against project objectives
Run through your design with your department buddy
Talk through and resolve any ux/design/tech queries discovered

###Develop
Ensure you run through with line manager / department buddies at key milestones
Make sure your approach is compatible for targeted browsers/devices along the way
Keep a high standard of code, including comments as well as execution

###Document
Ensure a project README.md has been completed
Check that any development environment, build and deployment instructions are included
Verify at least each function has been commented, and non obvious lines of code

---

###Debug & Test
Co-ordinate with your project manager to help deliver a test plan
Ensure targeted browsers / devices are supported and tested per specification document
Remember it’s your responsibility to test as you’re developing, don’t leave it all until the end
