##Types of developers

<br>**Barney – A Bad Developer**

Barney doesn’t care that he’s writing horrible code. The only thing he cares about getting the job done and on time. Nothing else matters. If it works, it works.
Barney writes horrible code which sometimes hinders the entire project’s progress. While the code works, it breaks so many things along the way that it sets the project back. Barney doesn’t feel like he needs to learn anything new.
He already knows everything there is to learn about <insert_language> in order to get things done.

<br>**Bill – A Mediocre Developer**

Bill is unaware that he’s writing horrible code. He’s following the team’s conventions and lint rules and thinks he’s doing ok. But he doesn’t take the time fully understand the entire project’s structure and how the different components interact.
The end result, unfortunately, is a pile of brittle mess.
Bill doesn’t consult with anyone before making huge design choices. He wings it. He read 3 blog posts a year ago and they have been guiding his decisions ever since.
I often say jumping into Bill’s code feels like a landmine. One wrong move and everything blows up in your face.

<br>**Roger – A Good Developer**

We’ve met Roger before. Completely aware of the fact that he’s writing horrible code. He knows how the code would have looked if he was writing good code. He pats himself on the back and moves on writing that piece of horrible code.
Roger’s main fault is that he doesn’t try to change anything. He does what he’s been asked to do and does it well. But Roger would rather leave things as they are instead of taking the time and making the effort to change them.

<br>**Ron – An Excellent Developer**

Ron is an excellent programmer. But he still has to write horrible code at times.
What sets Ron apart is that while he’s writing smelly code, he thinks hard how to make sure the situation doesn’t repeat itself. Not for him and not for anyone else. Ron figures out what type of refactoring is needed, and what methodologies can be changed or improved.
Ron then acts on his findings, taking action to put change in motion.
